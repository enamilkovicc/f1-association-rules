# Formula 1 Association Rules Data Mining Project

## Overview

This project employs association rules data mining to analyze a comprehensive dataset covering drivers, constructors, circuits, and race outcomes in the context of Formula 1.

## Project Structure

- `code/`: Contains the source code for the data mining process.
- `data/`: Includes the dataset.
- `outputs/`: Files produced.
- `results/`: Outcome of the data mining process, including association rules and evaluations.


## Data Source

The data for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020). Please refer to the terms and conditions of the data source for any licensing restrictions.

## Association Rules Data Mining

Association rules mining is the primary technique used in this project to uncover patterns and relationships within the F1 dataset. The Apriori algorithm is employed to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules, enabling the discovery of valuable insights into driver performance, circuit dynamics, and race outcomes.
